Filters
=======

We need filters:
   MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel (Bindings for libgsf would help)
   RTF
   Abiword
   Gnumeric
   mp3, ogg (and any other audio format that can carry metadata)
   pdf, postscript
   png, jpeg (and any other image format that can carry metadata)
   dvi (and maybe .tex -- we could just strip out the markup)
   Man pages
   Texinfo
   XML documentation format used by MonoDoc
   Code (throw away the code, extract comments and maybe strings)

The OpenOffice filter needs to read the embedded metadata.  (This
is blocking on bug 57907.)

The OpenOffice filter should notice when files are encrypted and fail
gracefully.


Indexing
========

IndexableFile should store more file properties:
   Ownership
   Permissions
   Filesystem metadata
   Nautilus Emblems

IndexMail needs to support IMAP.  The necessary changes to support Evo 1.5
IMAP summaries have been made to camel.cs --- it is solely a question of
walking ~/.evolution/mail/imap and doing the right thing.

The crawler should have a fast 'partial crawl' mode which searches a random
subset of the user's tree.  Ideally it would keep track of which directories
contain files that change frequently, and have a higher probability of
checking those during a partial crawl.

A 'fast crawl' mode could also look at the recently-used files and index
those.

The crawler should index folders as well as files.

It would be cool if the crawler could descend into compressed/tarred/zipped
files.

It would also be cool if the mail crawler could index MIME attachments
on mails in an mbox.  The mail indexer today just indexes the
text/plain parts of a mail; at the very least it could index the HTML
parts of a mail message.

A relatively easy project for someone would be to write a little viewer for IM
Logs that could be launched by clicking on an IM Log tile.  There is code in
Util/ImLog.cs for parsing gaim logs.

How we deal with locking the lucene index is fairly stupid.  Right now we
time out after 30 seconds of not being able to get the lock.  But since the
lockfiles contain the locking processes PID and a timestamp, we should be
able to:
  (1) Fail immediately if the locking process no longer exists.
  (2) Fail immediately if the process exists but the lock is too old
      (i.e. more than a few hours?)
  (3) Wait more-or-less indefinitely otherwise.
