Filters
=======

We need filters:

   - MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel (clahey has bindings in Mono cvs for
     libgsf)
   - RTF
   - mp3, ogg (and any other audio format that can carry metadata)
   - pdf, postscript
   - png, jpeg (and any other image format that can carry metadata)
   - dvi (and maybe .tex -- we could just strip out the markup)
   - Man pages
   - Texinfo
   - XML documentation format used by MonoDoc
   - Code (throw away the code, extract comments and maybe strings)
   - Abiword
   - Gnumeric

- The OpenOffice filter needs to read the embedded metadata. 

- The OpenOffice filter should notice when files are encrypted and fail
  gracefully.


Indexing
========

Filesystem
----------

* It would be cool if the crawler could descend into
  compressed/tarred/zipped files.  Perhaps it could use the GNOME VFS
  methods for this?

* IndexableFile should store more file properties:
     Ownership
     Permissions
     MTIME

Misc
----

* beagled is badly behaved!  It redirects stdout/stderr to /dev/null.
  All logging/spew is via Console.WriteLine.  It should also do
  more initialization before forking.

* Backends should be able to publish information to be returned by "ping".

* A relatively easy project for someone would be to write a little
  viewer for IM Logs that could be launched by clicking on an IM Log
  tile.  There is code in Util/ImLog.cs for parsing gaim logs.

Mail
----

* MailQueryable needs to support IMAP.  The necessary changes to support
  Evo 1.5 IMAP summaries have been made to camel.cs --- it is solely a
  question of walking ~/.evolution/mail/imap and doing the right thing.

* It would also be cool if the mail crawler could index MIME attachments
  on mails in an mbox.  The mail indexer today just indexes the
  text/plain parts of a mail; at the very least it could index the
  HTML parts of a mail message.
