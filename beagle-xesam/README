Beagle-Xesam
------------

This is a small adaptor that translates between the Xesam search API
(http://freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamSearchLive) and Beagle's native search
interface. It is currently not complete.

To test this, you need the DBus service and 'beagled' running. Install the
adaptor using the standard procedure (./configure && make && make install). The
adaptor is runusing the command 'beagle-xesam-adaptor'.

(See http://freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamSearchLive for an example client)
