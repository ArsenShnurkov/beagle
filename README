Beagle is an indexing sub-system and search aggregator built on top of
Lucene.Net.


FIRST, A WARNING
================

Beagle is very new, and is under heavy development.  It is buggy.

Very little effort has gone into optimizing anything yet, so certain
operations are slow and consume ridiculous amounts of memory.

Beagle uses a Mozilla plugin or an epiphany extension to track your web
browsing and index all of the (non-https://) web pages that you view.
If you don't like that sort of thing, you can disable it by setting the
BEAGLE_NO_WEB_INDEXING environment variable.


WHAT CAN BEAGLE DO?
===================

Beagle can index and search:
 * Your files (or at least the ones we have a filter for)
 * Your e-mail (as long as you are using mboxes and Evolution 1.5)
 * Your web browsing (if the Firefox plugin or epiphany extension
   is installed in the right place)
 * Your Gaim IM logs
 * Tomboy Notes

Beagle can also search:
 * Your addressbook (as long as you are using a very, very new
   version of evolution-data-server and have evolution-sharp 0.3 or better)
 * Google (if you have a Google Web API key from
   http://api.google.com/createkey and put that key in an environment
   variable named GOOGLE_WEB_API_KEY.)



HOW DO I INDEX MY DATA?
=======================

If you installed beagle into a different prefix than Firefox or
epiphany, they cannot detect the extension.

Also, the web indexing will only work if BEAGLE_PREFIX/bin is in your path.



HOW DO I SEARCH MY DATA?
========================

Beagle comes with two search tools.  Both are still very primitive.

There is a command-line tool called 'beagle-query'.  Just run:
 % beagle-query <thing to search for>
It's output is not particularly user-friendly.

There is also a graphical tool called 'best'.  It is a bit more user-friendly
that beagle-query.



BOY, THIS THING SUCKS.  HOW DO I FILE A BUG?
============================================

bugzilla.gnome.org, product 'beagle'.




KNOWN ISSUES
============

Google queries are currently broken due to a problem with Mono Beta 2.

The OpenOffice.org filter crashes on encrypted files.

The HTML filter doesn't know how to handle the windows-1252 encoding.

Sometimes bad things happen with Lucene's locking, leaving the index
inaccessible.  If anyone figures out how to reliably reproduce this problem,
please contact trow@ximian.com.
